### Hello and welcome to my github profile 👋
#### My name is Leo and I'm mostly developping iOS apps since 2015.
##### Here are a few points that'll let you know more about me 

##### 🌚 I'm a dark mode evangelist and I don't like sunlight like all developers
##### 💻 Remote ready, but I still like to come to the office and meet people 
##### 🧱 MVVM over MVC
##### 🤮 This is how I feel today about storyboards and segues
##### 🧩 I hate to copy paste code, that's why I try to build as much as possible reliable and reusable components
##### 📦 Cocoapods specialist, despite I'm not against Carthage or SPM
##### 🧭 Coordinators are one of the best way to deal with navigation of iOS apps
##### 🍕 Meetups are a great way to ~~get free food~~ open my mind to new practices
##### 🔭 I'm looking forward to SwiftUI and everything announced at WWDC2020

### 🌍 Feel free to visit [my website](https://leomarcotte.com) to view the apps I've been developping

#### Thank you for reading my profile and have a nice day!
